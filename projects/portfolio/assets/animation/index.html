		<h1>Animation</h1>
		<h3>Having watched children’s animation ranging from slapstick comedy to deep, heartfelt stories, I love the way in which animation <br>uses art to tell a unique story. I have a huge respect and love for children’s animation and the impact it can have on people.</h3>

		<h2>My most important piece of animation is my demo reel!</h2>

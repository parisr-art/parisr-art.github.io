		<h1>Design</h1>
		<h3>Design means many different things to me!</h3>
		<h2>Web Design</h2>
		<h3>My most interesting piece of web design is the webite that you are on right now! I created this website using HTML/CSS/JS with the goal to create a site showcasing my work as an animator/designer.</h3>
		<h3>Apart from this site, I have created three others that you can find at the links below. All three were projects I did for a class called Art of the Web that taught the basics of web design and front-end coding in html/css/js. There are few bugs in places! I was just learning!</h3>

		<h2>Motion Graphics</h2>
		<h3>With a strong passion for both animation and design, I have found that motion graphics is the perfect combination of my many interests as a creative. The following video was the final project for a Motion Graphics class I took taught in Adobe After Effects and Adobe Illustrator.</h3>
		<h2>Graphic Design</h2>
		<h3>From illustrating the sound of water to creating a social media illustration for a friend's student government campaign, my graphic design skills allow me to create visually appealing graphics in Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.</h3>
